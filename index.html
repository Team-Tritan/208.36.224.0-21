      <p>
        This page is regarding the IPv4 subnet 208.36.224.0/21, which was
        historically pointed to a Road Runner ASN in the early 2000s. Over the
        years, due to changes in ownership and multiple acquisitions, this
        subnet has been lost in bureaucracy, allowing us to announce it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our organization provides community-based ISP services, and we plan to
        utilize this IPv4 subnet to support our community while we grow. Despite
        its historical association with Road Runner, it has not been actively
        used since 2008. Since the acquisition of Road Runner and subsequent
        changes in ownership, this subnet has been sitting still, pointing to
        our ASN.
      </p>

      <p>
        We would like to emphasize our intention and request to continue to be
        allowed to announce this subnet, as it aligns with our commitment to
        providing reliable internet services to the BGP hobbyist community we
        serve. As we plan to utilize more than it has been used in the last
        <u>15 years</u> during the time of writing, we appreciate your
        understanding and cooperation in this matter.
      </p>

      <h2>The Downfalls of IPv4 Hogging</h2>
      <p>
        IPv4 hogging, where organizations hold onto more IP addresses than they
        need, contributes to the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses. This
        practice limits the pool of addresses available for new networks,
        hindering the growth of the internet and forcing the adoption of IPv6.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we navigate through the bureaucracy of our current digital landscape
        for ISPs, it's crucial to address these issues and ensure efficient
        allocation of IP resources for a sustainable and scalable internet
        infrastructure.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have insights into the mystery of the unused /21 subnet or
        thoughts on IPv4 conservation, share them with the community. Let's work
        together to unravel the mysteries of unused IP address space so we can
        put them to better use.
